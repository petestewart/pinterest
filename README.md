# PIИTEЯST
A single-page web app built with HTML , BOOTSTRAP, SASS, and JS that allows users to post images as "pins" which are organized into "boards". This was built as a group project assignment during my enrollment at [Nashville Software School](http://nashvillesoftwareschool.com/) while we were learning to use Firebase, Axios, and CRUD.

## Feature List
* User authorization with Google
* User can create pins and boards
* User can delete pins and boards
* User can re-assign pins to different boards
